General upgrade guide
----------------------------------
	1. Make a backup of your data in case something goes wrong. 
 
	2. Copy the files and folders from the upload/ directory to your OpenCart installation.
	   
	   NOTE: if you have made changes to translations, do not copy catalog/language and admin/language folders
	   since it will overwrite your translations. You need to compare new language files with the old ones and
	   merge them accordingly.
	   
	   Same applies to templates or any other files.

	3. Go to Multiseller - Settings menu in back office, configure any new options that may have been added and
	   save the settings.


Upgrading to version 1.2
----------------------------------
	1. Perform steps 1 & 2 from the general upgrade guide.
	
	2. Run the following SQL queries against your database:
		NOTE:
		- replace prefix_ with your OpenCart table prefix if necessary
		- replace DEFAULT '1' in the _SECOND_ query with DEFAULT '3' if you wish to enable manual product validation
		  for all sellers (this can be changed per seller later)
		- replace DEFAULT '0' in the _FIRST_ query with DEFAULT '0.5' (or any other decimal value), if you wish
		  to set flat commission fee for all sellers (can be changed per seller later)
		
		ALTER TABLE prefix_ms_seller ADD COLUMN `commission_flat` decimal(15,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';
		ALTER TABLE prefix_ms_seller ADD COLUMN `product_validation` tinyint(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1';
		ALTER TABLE prefix_ms_commission ADD COLUMN `commission_flat` decimal(15,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0';

	3. Perform step 3 from the general upgrade guide.
